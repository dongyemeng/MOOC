## Language Technology Progress
Mostly Solved | Making Good Progress | Still Really Hard
------------- | -------------------- | -----------------
Spam detection | Sentiment analysis | Question Answering (QA)
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging | Coreference resolution | Paraphrase
Named entity recognition (NER) | Word sense disambiguation (WSD) | Summarization
| Machine Translation (MT) | Dialog
| Information Extraction |

## Why NLP so hard?
* Ambiguity!
  * Syntactic ambiguity
  * Word sense ambiguity
* Others
  * non-standard English
  * segmentation issues
  * idioms
  * neologisms
  * world knowledge
  * tricky entity names

## What do we have to make progress in NLP?
* Knowledge about Language
* Knowledge about the world
* A way to combine knowledge sources: probabilistic models
